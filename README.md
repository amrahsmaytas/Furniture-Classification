# Furniture-Classification
iMaterialist Challenge (Furniture) at FGVC5, Kaggle Competition

### Pre-trained Model
For our first trial, we will use AlexNet to do transfer learning on this task.

1. Download [AlexNet weights](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/October/580d880c_bvlc-alexnet/bvlc-alexnet.npy), and save the `bvlc-alexnet.npy`
 on the main repo.

### Pre-Processing
1. Download training data, validation data and testing data by our script, in `download.ipynb`. For example, the jpg files of training data will be stored
 in `imaterialist-challenge-furniture-2018/train_data/`.
